# Public-Transport-Vehicle-Estimator
A Java program that allows you to estimate how many buses/trains/shuttles/etc. you would need for a given set of passengers.
The program accomplishes this by allowing users to find their ideal commute routes which are then saved and the admin account
can access. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find best routes, admin results are found through a simulation queue, and GUI work is 
done in Java Swing API.
